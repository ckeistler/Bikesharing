# Bikesharing

## Overview
The task that module 14 challenged us with was to use Tableau to create visualizations and perform analysis on bike sharing data from New York City.  The premise of the analysis and presentation was to, “convince investors that a bike-sharing program in Des Moines is a solid business proposal”.

## Results

Very few trips last longer than one hour

65.3% of all riders are Male, while 25.1% of riders are female.  9.6% of the riders have an unknown gender.

The 9.6% of data with unknown gender doesn't follow the trend of the curves set by either Male or Female.  The unknown gender curve is fairly flat, versus the steep declines #show in Male/Female riders as trip duration increases.  The chart below suggests women tend have longer trip times than men.

As the prior chart suggested, women do have longer average trip durations than men, while unknown riders have a trip duration that is nearly double that of women.

The heatmap of trips by weekday suggests that peak usage occurs during the morning and evening "rush hours" or as people are going to or coming from work.

The "rush hour" trend is at least somewhat noticeable in both male and female riders.  Given that 65% of the dataset includes male riders, the male occurance of the "rush hour" trend is more distinguishable.

Non-subscriber usage shows that the ratio of male to female usage is generally 2.0 or below for weekdays, whereas the same equation is closer to 3.0 for subscribers.

Thursday, Friday, and Saturday display considerably more rides than show Sunday-Wednesday.

The sum of total duration is highest on Saturdays.  With Fridays and Thursdays coming in 2nd and 3rd respectively.

While bike usage is highest Thursday-Saturday, Saturday and Sunday show average trip durations that are 20-30% higher than those occurring Monday-Friday.

## Summary
It would be very hard to convince investors that a bike-sharing program would be profitable in Des Moines without some demographic comparison between NYC and Des Moines, or without some statistics on tourism between the two cities.  Does Des Moines have a subway?  Is it easy to drive to/from work in Des Moines, and how does that differ from NYC.  You would need to prove that Des Moines provides enough opportunity/demand and then base the fleet size accordingly.  The dataset that we have doesn't allow us to make those determinations.

What we can say, however, is that men use the bikes in NYC more than women do, and that the times of usage on weekdays typically peaks during "rush hours" or periods of time that people make their commute to or from work.  Bike usage by men exceeds bike usage by women even on weekends, so the higher usage rates by men may be somewhat preferential. That said, and generally speaking, the labor force is comprised of more men than women (https://www.dol.gov/agencies/wb/data/widget).  The higher "rush hour" usage ratio by men coincides with this.  Total usage by "customers", or non-subscribers, shows that weekends bring more
